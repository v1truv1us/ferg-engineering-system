# Ferg Engineering System

## Who I Am
I'm an architect leading AI-assisted development across UnFergettable-Designs (client web dev) and ferg-cod3s (personal projects).

## Philosophy: Compounding Engineering
Each unit of work should make future work easier: Plan → Build → Review → Codify.

## Core Commands
- /plan — Create implementation plans
- /work — Execute plans with worktrees and todos
- /review — Multi-agent code review
- /seo — SEO audit
- /deploy — Deployment checklist (Coolify)
- /compound — Document learnings

## Project detection
Look for svelte.config.js, astro.config.mjs, go.mod, sst.config.ts to detect stack.
