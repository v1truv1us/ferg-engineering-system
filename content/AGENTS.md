# Content Repository Context

## Project Overview
Content repository for agents and commands documentation.

## Directory Structure
- `agents/` - Specialized agent documentation
- `commands/` - Command documentation and usage guides

## Code Style
- Use markdown format with frontmatter where applicable
- Maintain consistent documentation structure
- Include practical examples and usage patterns

## Key Content
**Agents:**
- `architect-advisor.md` - System architecture guidance
- `frontend-reviewer.md` - Frontend code review specialist
- `prompt-optimizer.md` - Prompt enhancement techniques
- `seo-specialist.md` - Technical SEO expertise

**Imported CodeFlow Agents (Enhanced with Research-Backed Prompting):**

### Development & Architecture
- `backend-architect.md` - System design and architecture decisions
- `database-optimizer.md` - Database performance and optimization
- `security-scanner.md` - Security vulnerability detection
- `api-builder-enhanced.md` - API development and documentation
- `full-stack-developer.md` - End-to-end application development
- `java-pro.md` - Java development with modern features

### Quality & Testing
- `code-reviewer.md` - Comprehensive code quality assessment
- `test-generator.md` - Automated test suite generation
- `performance-engineer.md` - Application performance optimization

### Operations & Infrastructure
- `infrastructure-builder.md` - Cloud infrastructure design
- `deployment-engineer.md` - Deployment automation and CI/CD
- `monitoring-expert.md` - Observability and alerting
- `cost-optimizer.md` - Cloud cost optimization

### AI & Machine Learning
- `ai-engineer.md` - AI integration and development
- `ml-engineer.md` - Machine learning model development

*All imported agents use maximum-level research-backed prompting techniques (+60-80% quality improvement) including expert personas, step-by-step reasoning, stakes language, and challenge framing.*

**Commands:**
- Mirrors `.claude/commands/` but with expanded documentation
- Each command includes detailed examples and best practices

## Integration Notes
- Content syncs with `.claude/` command definitions
- Agent docs reference parent AGENTS.md coordination
- Must maintain consistency between command implementations and documentation
